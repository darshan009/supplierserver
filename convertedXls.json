    "about":"Hock Seng was founded twenty-five years ago in 1980. Like most SME businesses, we started with very humble beginnings with deep traditional roots.\n\nFrom a modest wet market stall back in 1980, the owner believed in maintaining excellent quality in the production of his fish products. With a simple faith of wanting to bring the best to customers, faith in Hock Seng's quality fish products has thus earned its reliable clientele.\n\nAs the demand in production increased, the business base naturally needed more room for expansion. Through a sturdy relationship with our local bank and a group of extremely supportive friends, Hock Seng received its first batch of expansion capital. Grasping firmly and steadily on a small but truly essential belief in giving only the best to customers, Hock Seng on the same token, has also grown steadily in its business proportions over the 25 years to where we are today.
